# Calibration

This folder was used to calibrate the camera, and can be extended to other cameras. Simply erase the .png images in the corresponding folder, take >10 images of a calibration grid, pressing 'S' key, using take_images.py, then use calibration.py to compute thhe .pkl data necessary for undistorting the camera image. Don't forget to adapt the config at the beginning of the .py.
This folder is only present on the calibration git branch, for memory purpose.
